                        FighterFish test framework can be configured to run with or without an existing
                        GlassFish installation. When there is no existing GlassFish installation, the
                        test framework can download and install GlassFish. fighterfish.provisioner.url is
                        used to specify the download URL. com.sun.aas.installRoot is used to specify the
                        installation location. More over, if you are using maven protocol, then maven will cache it
                        in a local repo, hence subsequent test runs won't download from a remote location.
                        Furthermore, once GlassFish is installed, unless you remove the installation,
                        it gets reused during subsequent invocation of the tests.

                        The following example downloads GlassFish web distribution version 4.0-SNAPSHOT from maven repo.

                        will use a temporary location. If there is no preexisting installation in the
                        specified or derived directory, then the test framework will install GlassFish
