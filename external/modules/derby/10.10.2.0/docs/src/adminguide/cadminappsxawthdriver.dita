<section>
<p>You can use the <codeph>org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource</codeph>
class on Java SE 5 and above (except Java SE 8 Compact Profiles), in
applications that call JDBC 3 or JDBC 4.0 methods. You can use the
<codeph>org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource40</codeph> class on
Java SE 6 and above (except Java SE 8 Compact Profiles), in applications that
call JDBC 4.1 or JDBC 4.2 methods. You must use the
<codeph>org.apache.derby.jdbc.BasicClientXADataSource40</codeph> class on
Java SE 8 Compact Profile 2 or 3.</p>
<p>
If your client is running on the Java SE 6 platform or higher, all connection
objects returned from the DataSource will be JDBC 4 connection objects, whether
or not you are using a DataSource whose name ends in "40".
</p></section>
<example><p>The following example illustrates how to obtain an XA connection
with the network client driver:</p>
<codeblock>import org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientXADataSource;
import javax.sql.XAConnection;
...

XAConnection xaConnection = null;
Connection conn = null;

ClientXADataSource ds = new ClientXADataSource();

ds.setDatabaseName ("sample");
ds.setCreateDatabase("create");

ds.setServerName("localhost");
ds.setPortNumber(1527);

xaConnection = ds.getXAConnection("auser", "shhhh");

conn = xaConnection.getConnection();</codeblock></example>
