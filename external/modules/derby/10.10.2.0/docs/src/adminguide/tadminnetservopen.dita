<title>Running the Network Server without a security policy</title>
<shortdesc>You may override the Network Server's impulse to install a security
manager if, for some reason, you need to run your application outside
Java's security protections.</shortdesc>
<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>Network Server<indexterm>no security manager</indexterm></indexterm>

<taskbody>
<context>
<note othertype="" type="caution">You incur a severe security risk by opening
up the server to all clients without limiting access via user authentication and
a security policy.</note>
<p>Use the <codeph>-noSecurityManager</codeph> option to force the Network
Server to come up without a security manager. For example:
</p>
<codeblock><b>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start \
   -h localhost -noSecurityManager</b></codeblock>
</context>
</taskbody>
</task>
