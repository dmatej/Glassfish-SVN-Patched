<prolog><metadata>
<keywords><indexterm>JDBC methods<indexterm>differences with embedded

<conbody>
<p>These methods are as follows:</p>
<pre>
Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, String[] columnNames)
Connection.prepareStatement(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)

Statement.execute(String sql, String[] columnNames)
Statement.execute(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)
Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, String[] columnNames)
Statement.executeUpdate(String sql, int[] columnIndexes)
</pre>
<p>The differences in behavior are described in "Autogenerated keys" in the
