<title>Reclaiming unused space</title>
<shortdesc>A <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> table or
index (sometimes called a <i>conglomerate</i>) can contain unused space after
large amounts of data have been deleted or updated.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>This happens because, by default,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not return unused
space to the operating system. After a page has been allocated to a table or
index, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does not
automatically return the page to the operating system until the table or index
is dropped, even if the space is no longer needed. However,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> does provide a way to
reclaim unused space in tables and associated indexes.</p>
<p>If you determine that a table and its indexes have a significant amount
of unused space, use either the <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph>
or <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph> procedure to reclaim
that space. <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph> is guaranteed to
recover the maximum amount of free space, at the cost of temporarily creating
new tables and indexes before the statement is committed.
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph> attempts to reclaim
space within the same table, but cannot guarantee it will recover all available
space. The difference between the two procedures is that unlike
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph>, the
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph> procedure uses no
temporary files and moves rows around within the same conglomerate.</p>
<p>
You can use the <codeph>SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE</codeph> diagnostic table to
estimate the amount of unused space in a table or index by examining, in
particular, the values of the NUMFREEPAGES and ESTIMSPACESAVING columns. For
example:</p>
<codeblock><b>SELECT * FROM TABLE(SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY')) AS T</b></codeblock>
<p>For more information about
<codeph>SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE</codeph> see "SYSCS_DIAG diagnostic tables and
functions" in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
<example>
<p>As an example, after you have determined that the
<codeph>FlightAvailability</codeph> table and its related indexes have too much
unused space, you could reclaim that space with the following command:</p>
<codeblock><b>call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY', 0);</b></codeblock>
<p>The third parameter in the
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE</codeph> procedure determines
whether the operation will run in sequential or non-sequential mode. If you
specify <codeph>0</codeph> for the third argument in the procedure, the
operation will run in non-sequential mode. In sequential mode,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> compresses the table
and indexes sequentially, one at a time. Sequential compression uses less memory
and disk space but is slower. To force the operation to run in sequential mode,
substitute a non-zero SMALLINT value for the third argument. The following
example shows how to force the procedure to run in sequential mode:</p>
<codeblock><b>call SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE('APP', 'FLIGHTAVAILABILITY', 1);</b></codeblock>
</example>
