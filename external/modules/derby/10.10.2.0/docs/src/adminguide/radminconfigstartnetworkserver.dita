<section>
<p>Use the <codeph>derby.drda.startNetworkServer</codeph> property to simplify
embedding the Network Server in your Java application. When you set this
property to true, the Network Server will automatically start when you start
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> (in this context,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will start when the
embedded driver is loaded). Only one Network Server can be started in a JVM.</p>
<p><note>If you start the Network Server with this property set to true, the
Network Server will stop when your application ends or when you stop it by other
means (for example, by using the Java API or the command line interface, or by
shutting down the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
system), whichever comes first.</note></p>
