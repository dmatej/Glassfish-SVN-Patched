<section><p>A <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>&nbsp;<i>Connection</i> object
is not garbage-collected until all other JDBC objects created from that connection
are closed or are themselves garbage-collected. Once the connection
is closed, no further JDBC requests can be made against objects created from
the connection. Do not explicitly close the <i>Connection</i> object until
you no longer need it for executing statements.<indexterm>Connections<indexterm>garbage

<section>
<p>The <i>Connection</i> interface extends <i>AutoCloseable</i> in JDK 7 and
after. If you declare a connection in a <i>try</i>-with-resources statement and
there is an error that the code does not catch, the JRE will attempt to close
the connection automatically.</p>
<p>Note that a transaction-severity or higher exception causes
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to abort an in-flight
transaction. But a statement-severity exception does NOT roll back the
transaction. Also note that
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> throws an exception if
an attempt is made to close a connection with an in-flight transaction. Suppose
now that a <i>Connection</i> is declared in a <i>try</i>-with-resources
statement, a transaction is in-flight, and an unhandled statement-severity error
occurs inside the <i>try</i>-with-resources block. In this situation,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will raise a follow-on
exception as the JRE exits the <i>try</i>-with-resources block. (For details on
error severity levels, see
<i><xref href="rrefproper26985.dita#rrefproper26985"></xref></i>.)</p>
<p>It is therefore always best to catch errors inside the
<i>try</i>-with-resources block and to either roll back or commit, as
appropriate, to ensure that there is no pending transaction when leaving the
<i>try</i>-with-resources block. This action also improves application
portability, since DBMSs differ in their semantics when trying to close a
connection with a pending transaction.</p>
