<title>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INVALIDATE_STORED_STATEMENTS system procedure</title>
<shortdesc>The <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INVALIDATE_STORED_STATEMENTS</codeph>
system procedure invalidates all stored prepared statements (that is, all
statements in the SYSSTATEMENTS system table).</shortdesc>
<refbody>
<section><p>The next time one of the invalid stored prepared statements in the
<xref href="rrefsistabs33768.dita#rrefsistabs33768"></xref> is executed, it will
be recompiled, and a new plan will be generated for it.</p>
<p>Run <codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INVALIDATE_STORED_STATEMENTS</codeph> whenever
you think that your metadata queries or triggers are misbehaving -- for example,
if they throw <codeph>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError</codeph> or
<codeph>java.lang.NoSuchMethodException</codeph> on execution.
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> stores plans for
triggers and metadata queries in the database. These should be invalidated
automatically on upgrade and at other necessary times. Should you encounter an
instance where they are not, you have found a bug that you should report, but
one that you can likely work around by running
<codeph>SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_INVALIDATE_STORED_STATEMENTS</codeph>.</p></section>

<section><title>Execute privileges</title>
<p>If authentication and SQL authorization are both enabled, only the
<xref href="rrefattrib26867.dita#rrefattrib26867">database owner</xref> has
execute privileges on this procedure by default. See "Enabling user
authentication" and "Setting the SQL standard authorization mode" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citdevelop"></ph> for more information. The
database owner can grant access to other users.</p>
