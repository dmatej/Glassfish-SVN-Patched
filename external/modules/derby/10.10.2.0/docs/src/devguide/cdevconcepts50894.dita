<title>Debugging deadlocks</title>
<shortdesc>If deadlocks occur frequently in your multi-user system with a
particular application, you might need to do some debugging.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides the
SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table to help you debug deadlocks. This
diagnostic table shows all of the locks that are currently held in the <ph
conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database. 
You can reference the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table directly
in a statement.</p>
<p>For
    example:<codeblock>SELECT * FROM SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE</codeblock></p>
<p>When
the SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table is referenced in a statement, a
snapshot of the lock table is taken.
</p><p>
For more information about how to use this table, see
"SYSCS_DIAG.LOCK_TABLE diagnostic table" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.</p>
<p>You
can also set the property <i>derby.locks.deadlockTrace</i> to dump additional
information to the <i>derby.log</i> file about any deadlocks that occur on your
system. See <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> for more information
on this property. Also see "Monitoring deadlocks" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p>
<p>Additional general information about diagnosing locking problems can be
    found in the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
