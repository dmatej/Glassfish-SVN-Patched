<ul>
<li>System-wide identity: Currently, any legal system-wide identity enjoys
authorization to perform the following operations:
<ul>
<li>Create databases</li>
<li>Restore databases</li>
<li>Shut down the <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
engine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Database-specific identity: If you are a legal identity in a specific
database, you may enjoy the following rights:
<ul>
<li>You can connect to that database, provided that coarse-grained connection
authorization has not been set to <i>noAccess</i>.</li>
<li>You can shut down that database, encrypt it, and upgrade it, provided that
you are the database owner.</li>
<li>You can create your own SQL objects and write data to your own tables,
provided that your coarse-grained connection authorization has not been set to
<i>readOnlyAccess</i>.</li>
<li>You can access other SQL objects, provided that the owners have granted you
fine-grained SQL access to those objects, and provided you have not been limited
by coarse-grained <i>readOnlyAccess</i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between fine-grained SQL authorization and coarse-grained
connection authorization is described in
<xref href="cdevcsecure36595.dita#cdevcsecure36595"></xref>.</p>
