<title>Explicitly closing Statements, ResultSets, and Connections</title>
<shortdesc>You should explicitly close <codeph><i>Statements</i></codeph>,
<codeph><i>ResultSets</i></codeph>, and <codeph><i>Connections</i></codeph> when
you no longer need them, unless you declare them in a
<codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources statement (available in JDK 7 and
after).</shortdesc>

<keywords><indexterm>Explicit close of JDBC objects</indexterm></keywords>
</metadata></prolog>
<conbody>
<p>Connections to <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> are
resources external to an application, and the garbage collector will not close
them automatically. </p>
<p>To close a <codeph><i>Statement</i></codeph>,
<codeph><i>ResultSet</i></codeph>, or <codeph><i>Connection</i></codeph> object
that is not declared in a <codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources statement,
use its <codeph><i>close</i></codeph> method. If auto-commit is disabled, you
must explicitly commit or roll back active transactions before you close the
connection.</p>
<p>Statements, result sets, and connections extend
<codeph><i>AutoCloseable</i></codeph> in JDK 7 and after. If you declare a
connection in a <codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources statement and there
is an error that the code does not catch, the JRE will attempt to close the
connection automatically.</p>
<p>Note that a transaction-severity or higher exception causes
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> to abort an in-flight
transaction. But a statement-severity exception does NOT roll back the
transaction. Also note that
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> throws an exception if
an attempt is made to close a connection with an in-flight transaction. Suppose
now that a <codeph><i>Connection</i></codeph> is declared in a 
<codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources statement, a transaction is
in-flight, and an unhandled statement-severity error occurs inside the
<codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources block. In this situation,
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> will raise a follow-on
exception as the JRE exits the <i>try</i>-with-resources block. (For details on
error severity levels, see the documentation of the
<codeph><i>derby.stream.error.logSeverityLevel</i></codeph> property in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph>.)</p>
<p>It is therefore always best to catch errors inside the
<codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources block and to either roll back or
commit, as appropriate, to ensure that there is no pending transaction when
leaving the <codeph><i>try</i></codeph>-with-resources block. This action also
improves application portability, since DBMSs differ in their semantics when
trying to close a connection with a pending transaction.</p>
