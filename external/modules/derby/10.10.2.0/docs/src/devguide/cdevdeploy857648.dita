<title>Notes on dynamic changes</title>
<shortdesc>Remember the following items when you make dynamic changes to jar
files or to the classpath.</shortdesc>
<prolog></prolog>
<conbody>
<ul>
<li>When you are changing the <i>derby.database.classpath</i> property, all
classes loaded from database jar files are reloaded, even for a jar file that
has not changed.</li>
<li>Remember that the user's classpath is searched first.</li>
<li>Any existing prepared statements will use the previously loaded classes
unless they require class loading, in which case they will fail with a
<i>ClassNotFound</i> error.</li>
<li>Cached objects do not match objects created with newly loaded classes.
For example, an in-memory <i>Customer</i> object will not match a new
<i>Customer</i> object if the <i>Customer</i> class has been reloaded, and it
will raise a <i>ClassCastException</i>.</li>
</ul>
