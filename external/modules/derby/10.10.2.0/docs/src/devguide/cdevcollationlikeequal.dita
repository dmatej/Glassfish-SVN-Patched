<title>Differences between LIKE and equal (=) comparisons</title>
<shortdesc>When you use locale-based collation, the comparisons
can return different results when you use the LIKE and equal
(=) operators.</shortdesc>

<p>For example, suppose that the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> database is set to use
a locale where the character 'z' has the same collation elements as 'xy'. 
Consider the following two WHERE clauses:</p>
<ol>
<li>WHERE 'zcb' = 'xycb'</li>
<li>WHERE 'zcb' LIKE 'xy_b'</li>
</ol>
<p>For WHERE clause 1, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
returns TRUE, because the collation elements for the entire string 'zcb' will
match the collation elements of the entire string 'xycb'.</p>
<p>For WHERE clause 2, <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
returns FALSE, because the collation element for the character 'z' does not
match the collation element for the character 'x'. In addition, when a
metacharacter such as an underscore is used with the LIKE operator, the
metacharacter counts for one character in the string value. A clause such as
<codeph>WHERE 'xycb' LIKE '_cb'</codeph> returns FALSE, because
'x' is compared to the metacharacter '_' and 'y' does not match 'c'.</p>
