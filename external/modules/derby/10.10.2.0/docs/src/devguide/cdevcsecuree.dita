<title>Configuring security for
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph></title>
<shortdesc><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> can be
deployed in a number of ways and in a number of different environments, ranging
from a single-user deployment for small-scale development and testing to a
multi-user deployment of a large database. For all but the smallest deployments,
however, it is essential to make the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system secure.</shortdesc>

<conbody>
<p>To secure a <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
database or databases, take the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the concept of identity in
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>.
<p>See <xref href="cdevcsecureidentity.dita#cdevcsecureidentity"></xref> for
details.</p></li>
<li>Understand the basic tasks involved in configuring security in a
client-server environment or an embedded environment.
<p>See <xref href="cdevcsecure12392.dita#cdevcsecure12392"></xref> for
details.</p></li>
<li>Configure <i>authentication</i> by setting up users and passwords.
<p>Authentication determines whether someone is a legal user. It establishes
a user's identity. <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph>
verifies user names and passwords before permitting access to the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> system.</p>
<p>For more information about authentication, see
<xref href="cdevcsecure42374.dita#cdevcsecure42374"></xref>.</p></li>
<li>Configure <i>user authorization</i> for the system.
<p>Authorization determines what operations can be performed by a user's
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> identity. 
Authorization grants users or roles permission to read a database or to write
to a database.</p>
<p>For more information about authorization, see
<xref href="cdevcsecure36595.dita#cdevcsecure36595"></xref>.</p></li>
<li>Encrypt your databases.
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> provides ways to
encrypt data stored on disk.</p>
<p>For more information about encryption, see
<xref href="cdevcsecure24366.dita#cdevcsecure24366"></xref>.</p></li>
<li>Sign any jar files that you use in your databases.
<p><ph conref="../conrefs.dita#prod/productshortname"></ph> validates
certificates for classes loaded from signed jar files.</p>
<p>For more information about using signed jar files, see
<xref href="cdevcsecure90988.dita#cdevcsecure90988"></xref>.</p></li>
<li>Encrypt network traffic with SSL/TLS.
<p>SSL/TLS certificate authentication is also supported. See
"Network encryption and authentication with SSL/TLS" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> for details.</p></li>
<li>Customize the default security policy.
<p>For details, see <xref href="cdevcbabejdfj.dita#cdevcbabejdfj"></xref>, and
see "Running the Network Server under the security manager" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p></li>
<li>If necessary, restrict database file access to the operating system account
that started the JVM.
<p>For details, see "Controlling database file access" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The section "Derby Network Server advanced topics" in the
<ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citadmin"></ph> has more information on
security issues. The <ph conref="../conrefs.dita#pub/citref"></ph> describes
many security-related properties and system procedures, as well as such
statements as GRANT, REVOKE, CREATE ROLE, DROP ROLE, CREATE PROCEDURE, and
CREATE FUNCTION.</p>
