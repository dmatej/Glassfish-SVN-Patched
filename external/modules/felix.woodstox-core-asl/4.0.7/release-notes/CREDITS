Tatu Saloranta, tatu.saloranta@iki.fi: Author
Benson Margulies : Co-author

Christian Niles:
  * Pointed out an improvement to the woodstox.jar to add service
    entries under META-INF so that Woodstox will auto-register
    as a Stax implementation.
    to use
    [0.8.3]

James Fogarty:
  * Found 3 bugs (getElementText() not working, incorrect index offset
    for non-ns getAttributeLocalName(), index-out-of-bounds when there
    were lots of attribute names whose hashes collide)
    [1.0]

James Strachan:
  * Found problems with stream writer; namespace repairing mode was not
    working as expected
    [1.0]

Stepan Koltsov:
  * Found problems with event reader: was setting peeked event to null, yet
    trying to de-reference it
    [1.0]

Mat Gessel:
  * Pointed out a problem with XMLStreamReader.nextTag() implementation;
    was not skipping comments and PIs
    [1.0]

Dan Diephouse:
  * Reported problems with QName construction (null prefix causes
    exception on some QName implementations)
    [1.0.1]
  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)
    [2.0.3/2.7]
  * Pointed out code that could be used to resolve [WSTX-26].

Sven Köhler:
  * Reported the problem with blocking input streams, and behaviour of
    the UTF8 decoder Woodstox uses: this could cause "too early" blocking
    of readers, in cases where event(s) could be returned before needing
    to read more from underlying input stream.
    [1.0.4/1.7]
  * Reported a bug in stream writer; a call to writeEmptyElement() followed
    by a call to writeEndElement() ignored latter call.
    [1.0.5/1.8.2]

Casey Bowman:
  * Pointed out the (potential) problem with javax.xml.stream.Location;
    return values are ints, and may thus overflow for BIG documents.
    StAX2 extensions (XMLStreamLocation2) added to properly deal with
    the problem.
    [1.8]

Stefan Wachter:
  * Reported a problem with handling of large documents; was sometimes
    throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception (mostly when dealing
    with gzipped streams).
    [1.0.3/1.8.1]

Eric Jain:
  * Reported a bug in default namespace handling; was reporting a bogus
    problem when declaring an explicit namespace before the default one
    on a start element
    [1.0.3/1.8.1]
  * Re-reported the problem with UTF-8 streams and array bounds (originally
    reported by Stefan Wachter), and provided unit test to reproduce it.
    [1.0.4/1.8.1]

Marius Raschip:
  * Reported a problem with handling of UTF-16 (and in general all non-UTF-8
    multi-byte encodings): wasn't handling xml declaration correctly.
    [1.0.5/1.8.2]

Olivier Potonniee:
  * Reported compilation problems (incorrect package name for one class,
    conflicting method name for LineSuppressWriter)
    [1.0.6/1.9]

Ron Yang:
  * Reported an intermittent problem caused by broken handling of SymbolTable
    sharing, and also pointed out a potential solution (had been fixed for
    2.0 branch earlier, but not for 1.0.x).
    [1.0.7]

Ulrich Callmeier:
  * Reported a bug with START_DOCUMENT handling of XMLStreamWriter
    implementation
    [1.0.7/2.0.0]
  * Reported a bug with the input factory: entity and dtd resolvers were
    not being properly passed to instances
    [1.0.7/2.0.0]
  * Report a bug with WriterBase, base class for all encoding writers
    (attribute, element text): an NPE was thrown when trying to output
    encoded characters.
    [2.0.1/3.0.0]
  * Reported a bug in DTD-handling; DTDs that had enumerated value "-"
    (or "--"), were throwing an exception.
    [2.0.1/3.0.0]

Peter Tauter:
  * Reported a bug with WriterBase; see the entry next to Ulrich for details.

Linus Ericson:
  * Reported bugs:
    * [WSTX-3]: WDTD.java was missing one double quote from output
      [2.0.2/3.0.0]
    * [WSTX-7] SimpleNsStreamWriter was stripping out attribute namespaces
      [2.0.3/3.0.0]
    * [WSTX-114]: Handling of ID attribute values broken, in non-namespace
      mode: last character was dropped.
      [3.2.0/4.0.0]

Patrick D'Cruze:
  * Reported [WSTX-8]; nextTag() followed by peek() at the start of a
    document did not work.
    [2.0.3/3.0.0]

Erik Smith:
  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)
    [2.0.3/3.0.0]

  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)

  * Reported [WTSX-59]: Stream writer tries to quote \r and \t in
    prolog and epilog.
  * Pointed out countless other bugs based on extensive Nux and Xom
    xml compatibility suites (and w3c compatibility suite as well).
  * Pointed out multiple optimization possibilities (both on reader and
    writer side), esp. via performance
    test suite Nux has: this helped performance tuning of 3.0 release
    significantly.
  * Reported [WSTX-65], [WSTX-66] and [WSTX-67], regarding event handling
    problems.
    [3.0.0]

    arguments passed to StringUtil.matches()

    which allowed otherwise hard-to-track problem to be quite easily
    resolved. Problem was that event writer could produce non-wellformed
    output for medium/large-sized content, when using Latin1 encoding.
    [3.0.3/3.1.0]

Michael Haeusler:
  * Reported [WSTX-88], suggested fix; Latin1 output wasn't working
    correctly: some characters in range 0x80 - 0xFF were output both
    as is, and as character entities
    [3.0.3/3.1.0]

  * Reported [WSTX-89], with sample document that exhibits the problem:

    some cases (boundary condition with Windows, \r\n, linefeeds)
    [3.1.1]
  * Reported [WSTX-97], with sample document and code to reproduce
    the problem: Character offsets (for XMLStreamReader.getLocation())
    were sometimes decremented
    [3.1.1]
  * Reported [WSTX-141], supplied test case demonstrate it:
    Copying of CDATA events using XMLEventWriter was producing
    garbled output.
    [3.2.4/4.0.0]

Davanum Srinivas:
  * Reported [WSTX-90], submitted a patch (used as the guideline for
    the changes): output writing efficiency could be improved by
    using System.arraycopy() instead of basic character copying.
    Can improve speed even for relatively short strings, it turns out.
    [3.2.0]
  * Reported [WSTX-91], submitted patch (regression caused by changes
    for [WSTX-90]); array index of bounds on stream writer.
    [3.2.0]
