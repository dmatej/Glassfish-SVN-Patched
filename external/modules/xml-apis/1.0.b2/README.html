<h3>xml-commons is a new xml.apache.org subproject!</h3>
<p>xml-commons is focused on common code and guidelines for xml projects.
It's first focus will be to organize and have common packaging for the various externally-defined 
standards code relating to XML - things like the DOM, SAX, and JAXP interfaces.</p>
<p>As the xml-commons community forms, we also hope to serve as a holding area 
for other common xml-related utilities and code, and to help promulgate common 
packaging, testing, documentation, and other guidelines across all 
xml.apache.org subprojects.</p>

<p>As the community forms, we need to formalize these guidelines, especially to differentiate 
'requirements' from suggested 'guidelines'.</p>
<p>Shane's starting proposals:
<br>xml-commons is an unusual project in several ways.  
First, it encompasses two kinds of code: external and apache.  
<br>Secondly, 
xml-commons mainly focuses on providing code and services to other 
xml.apache.org projects instead of shipping it's own 'standalone' project.  
<br>Third, it will also tend to be more focused on smaller, interoperable modules of 
code and a very high degree of stability.</p>
<p>In some ways, the forming of 
xml-commons is the seed of a catalyst to improve cross-project coordination 
throughout xml.apache.org.  One potential goal is to get all xml.apache.org 
projects to take their xml standards oriented code - like DOM, SAX and JAXP - 
from specific marked builds of xml-commons, instead of each project 
using different versions of these files.</p>
<p><b>External code:</b> xml-commons will serve as an Apache-controlled 
copy of externally-defined standards-based files.  This way, we can try 
to manage common versions of these important xml standards-based files
and interfaces. Read more <a href="#external">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Apache code:</b> xml-commons will serve as a shared repository for 
common xml-oriented utilities or building blocks that several other 
xml.apache.org projects wish to use.  The first example is org.apache.env.Which, 
and environment checking utility that scans your environment and reports common 
versions of xml-related files.  The next likely submission is an entity resolver 
that could be plugged into any xml parsing, transforming, or processing 
project.  Read more <a href="#java">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>We should consider adopting those guidelines from the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/">jakarta-commons</a> 
project that make sense for our xml projects - keeping in mind that both the kind of 
projects we build are different than jakarta, and some of our goals are a 
little bit different.</li>
<li>Dicsussion and buy-in should happen on the project mailing list 
<b>before</b> checking in new modules.</li>
<li>New modules generally shouldn't go in until at least two separate 
other projects express interest in using the module.  I think this is an 
important difference from jakarta-commons that makes sense in our world. 
I.e. I'd rather not just throw something in because it seems like it might 
be useful, I'd rather only put things in that we know will be shared among 
multiple projects.</li>
<li>The xml-commons community should come up with guidelines for other 
xml.apache.org subprojects to use the code that commons has. I.e. suggestions 
and ways to package this code vis-a-vis the other project's code in a common way.</li>
<li>Other shared xml.apache.org guidelines? Like documentation format, testing techniques/policies, etc.</li>

List:     xml-apache-general
Subject:  [VOTE] Proposal: new xml-commons subproject for standards-based files
From:     Shane_Curcuru@lotus.com
Date:     2001-04-17 16:08:07

I propose a new xml.apache.org/xml-commons subproject to fulfill the need
for a central repository for various XML standards-based files and common
tools.

COMMITTERS-PLEASE-VOTE! Although I'm not sure of the exact voting procedure
for creating whole new subprojects, I'm hoping to see a bunch of +1's to
start with; feel free to either reply-to or use the handy mini-xml ballot
below.

NON-COMMITTERS-PLEASE-DISCUSS! While votes from non-committers are not
binding your discussion and insights are very valuable!

xml-subproject-proposal-commons-v1.1
Proposal: form a new xml.apache.org subproject called xml-commons to
fulfill the below needs.

(0) Rationale:
Many xml.apache.org projects use and ship with sets of similar
externally-defined standards-based code; differences in versioning and
configuration of this code often make developing and using our projects
more difficult.  A common place for all xml.apache.org projects to get DOM,
SAX, JAXP, and other externally-defined code would be a fairly low-cost and
low-maintenance way to alleviate these difficulties.  Having a subproject
and a community focused on cross-xml-subproject issues will also help drive
better cross-project coordination and tooling.

(0.1) Programming Languages: While the coding details of Java/C/Perl/etc
are obviously different, the core concept is the same: a central repository
for all xml.apache.org projects to share common interfaces and utilities.
We should start with xml-commons/java, xml-commons/c, and xml-commons/perl
since these languages are in current use in various xml.apache.org
subprojects today.


(1) Scope of this subproject:

(1.1) Common externally-defined standards:
This includes the packages: org.w3c.dom.**, org.xml.sax.**, and javax.xml.
**  This is designed to essentially be an xml.apache.org-specific holding
place for commonly-used interfaces/headers that are created outside of
Apache.  This subproject should provide guidelines and build scripts to aid
xml.apache.org groups to easily use these common files in a common manner
across all subprojects.  This subproject should provide some basic
versioning abilities so that xml.apache.org projects temporarily using
new/beta/updated/proposed versions of these specs can continue to get their
code from this area.

(1.2) Common xml-oriented utilities:
We should also include additional utilities/common code in this subproject,
like current copies of bsf.jar, stylebook, servlet API classes, etc.  This
could also include code that did originate in an Apache project, that we
wanted to centralize the use of: SystemIDResolver, XML Serializers, etc.

(1.3) General project starting guidelines for future directions/scope:
While the details of guidelines for this work should be finalized by the
community that forms it (along with input from the other xml.apache.org
projects who will be using this code), there are some basics to start with:
- Communicate status regularly with general@xml.apache.org and with other
subprojects
- Clearly document and checkin 'best practices' for usage of xml-commons
code in other subprojects
- Proactively work with other subprojects to implement and improve our
'best practices'
- Provide upgrade paths and help; deprecate (or equivalent) old API's
before removing, so other subprojects have ample time to upgrade.
- Test and document all non-standards-based code; provide tests/additional
documentation for standards-based code

(1.4) General guidelines for future directions/scope:
Note this is firstly a subproject to make life inside of xml.apache.org
easier, to enable us to more efficiently develop nifty XML projects.  As we
gain experience in developing this subproject, an obvious future direction
for this community will be to work on a potential AXDK (Apache XML
Development Kit) that would be a meta-packaging-project composed out of
several xml projects together.  The AXDK would be a way to make life for
end-users easier: a single package of various Apache XML tools that works
'out of the box'. (AXDK naming credit to kellyc I think?)

(1.5) Interaction with other subprojects
Additional guidelines can be drawn up on general@xml.apache.org for this
subproject, and then documented and checked in.  These should include both
how other xml subprojects should use these resources in their development
cycles, as well as how all xml subprojects should package these resources
when creating public, shipped distributions (to avoid version conflicts,
etc.)  This subproject's community, along with general@xml.apache.org, will
need to draw up guidelines for code within this subproject as well.


(2) Identify the initial source from which the subproject is to be
populated:
Standards-based sources would be obtained from the relevant owners/creators
and checked into the project repository. A basic build.xml file and apache
project usage guidelines would need to be created.  Possible legal review
would be needed for licensed files (one solution might be to waive the
Apache license on these files).  For common xml-oriented utilities, the
initial sources can be moved in from other xml.apache.org subprojects (cf.
potential org.apache.xml.utils.SystemIdResolver from xml-xalan).


(3) Identify the xml.apache.org resources to be created

(3.1) mailing list(s)
xml-commons-dev
(ed note: added xml-commons-cvs as well -Shane)

(3.2) CVS repositories
xml-commons

(3.3) Bugzilla
program: Commons
components: External Standards, Common XML Utils


xml-subproject-proposal-commons-v1.1-committers
A sub-issue that I'd like people to vote on separately for whichever of the
below option(s) they like best.
(4) Identify the initial set of committers

(4.a) [vote-multiple] kellyc, curcuru, rubys
(4.b) [vote-multiple] one committer from each xml.apache.org subproject
that wants to volunteer, plus at least one PMC member (for projects that
don't get someone volunteered)
(4.c) [vote-multiple] all current xml.apache.org committers

/xml-subproject-proposal-commons-v1.1-committers

/xml-subproject-proposal-commons-v1.1


(*) Important cross-reference:
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/index.html
Jakarta is currently working on a similar, yet different, tool/util/common
code area.  While we can steal a lot of their ideas, I think the needs of
xml.apache.org will be different than Jakarta, so we should make our own
community decision on how to do this.  Many thanks to the nice format for a
proposal that I plagarized.  8-)
