<h1>SAX2: Filters</h1>

<blockquote>
<p class="copyright">This document is in the Public Domain.</p>

<p>The SAX interface assumes two basic streams:</p>

<ol>
<li>a stream of requests flowing from the application to the SAX
driver; and</li>
<li>a stream of events (and other information) flowing from the SAX
driver to the application.</li>
</ol>

<p>With SAX1, programmers quickly realized that it was possible to
extend this model to support a processing chain, where requests could
flow through several different components, or filters, before arriving 
at the original SAX driver, and events could flow through the same
filters before arriving at the application.  Each filter can make
changes to the stream of events as it passes through, but the whole
chain of filters still appears to be a single SAX driver to the
application.</p>

<p>SAX2 formalizes this design technique by adding a new interface, <a
href="javadoc/org/xml/sax/XMLFilter.html">org.xml.sax.XMLFilter</a>,
and a new helper class, <a
href="javadoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/XMLFilterImpl.html"
>org.xml.sax.XMLFilterImpl</a>.</p>

<p>The <var>XMLFilter</var> interface itself is very simple, extending
the basic <var>XMLReader</var> interface with two additional
methods:</p>

<blockquote><pre xml:space="preserve">
public interface XMLFilter extends XMLReader
{
  public abstract void setParent (XMLReader parent);
  public abstract XMLReader getParent ();
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In other words, a SAX2 filter is simply an XMLReader that has
another XMLReader as its parent.</p>

<p>In normal use, a filter will implement not only the
<var>XMLFilter</var> interface but also one or all of the various
resolver and handler interfaces (<var>EntityResolver</var>,
<var>DTDHandler</var>, <var>ContentHandler</var>, and
<var>ErrorHandler</var>).  To the parent XML reader, the filter is the
client application receiving the events; to the client application,
the filter is the SAX driver producing the events.</p>

<p>The <var>XMLFilterImpl</var> helper class provides a convenient
base for deriving SAX2 filters.  This class implements the
<var>XMLFilter</var>, <var>EntityResolver</var>,
<var>DTDHandler</var>, <var>ContentHandler</var>, and
<var>ErrorHandler</var> interfaces.  By default, it passes all events
on unmodified, but the derived filter can override specific
methods.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a very simple filter that changes the
Namespace URI <code>http://www.foo.com/ns/</code> to
<code>http://www.bar.com/</code> wherever it appears in an element
name (but not an attribute name):</p>

<blockquote><pre xml:space="preserve">
public class FooFilter extends XMLFilterImpl
{
  public FooFilter ()
  {
  }

  public FooFilter (XMLReader parent)
  {
    super(parent);
  }


  /**
   * Filter the Namespace URI for start-element events.
   */
  public void startElement (String uri, String localName,
                            String qName, Attributes atts)
    throws SAXException
  {
    if (uri.equals("http://www.foo.com/ns/")) {
      uri = "http://www.bar.com/ns/";
    }
    super.startElement(uri, localName, qName, atts);
  }


  /**
   * Filter the Namespace URI for end-element events.
   */
  public void endElement (String uri, String localName, String qName)
    throws SAXException
  {
    if (uri.equals("http://www.foo.com/ns/")) {
      uri = "http://www.bar.com/ns/";
    }
    super.endElement(uri, localName, qName);
  }

}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note the use of <var>super.startElement</var> and
<var>super.endElement</var> to send the event on to the client.  In a
real filter, it would be good to override the
<var>ContentHandler.startPrefixMapping</var> and
<var>ContentHandler.endPrefixMapping</var> methods as well.</p>

<p>Long filter chains are not always the best approach, but you will
find that it is sometimes easier to build complex XML applications if
you can break them down into a collection of simple SAX filters, each
one reading the events from its parent.</p>
