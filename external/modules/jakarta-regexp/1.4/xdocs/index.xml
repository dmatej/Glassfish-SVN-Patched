<p>
Jakarta Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package that was graciously 
donated to the Apache Software Foundation by Jonathan Locke. He originally wrote 
this software back in 1996 and it has stood up quite well to the test of time. 
It includes complete Javadoc documentation as well as a simple <a href="applet.html">
applet</a> for visual debugging and testing suite for compatibility.
</p>

<p>
This package is intended to be an answer to a question we commonly hear in the 
Java world:
<blockquote style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #eee;">
&quot;Why isn't there a decent regular expression package available for 
Java under a BSD-Style (ie: Apache) license?&quot;
</blockquote>
